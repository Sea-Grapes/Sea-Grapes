# Hi, I'm Sea Grapes ðŸ‘‹

I like to make random projects on the web. Sometimes they actually function properly.  
I am also very lazy and basically never finish anything lmao

## Stack
- All the random crap ive used since time immemorial
- Web app stuff, Tools, libraries
- Is it just me or is this font size tiny??

[![Web app stuff](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,nodejs,svelte,react,tailwind)](http://localhost:5173/)  
[![Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=figma,ps,ai,vscode,vite,vercel,replit)](http://localhost:5173/)  
[![Libraries](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=threejs,tauri)](http://localhost:5173/)

### What I'm doing recently
- So apparently I'm required to become a Java now (for school). Hooray... I guess i can modd minecraff lol (or build 500 microservices)
- Java is pretty `SimpleBeanFactoryAwareAspectInstanceFactory` imo. But Ig its kinda nice to have method overloading (hi haskellers). And ig focusing on classes is kinda nice for organization?
- Also, working on some super secret personal projects ðŸ‘€ Launching soonâ„¢

I doubt anyone will actually ever read this but if you do, hi :)

# Hi, I'm Sea Grapes ðŸ‘‹

I like to make random projects on the web. Sometimes they actually function properly.  
I am also very lazy and basically never finish anything lmao

# Stack
- All the random crap ive used since time immemorial
- Web app stuff, Tools, libraries
- Is it just me or is this font size tiny??
